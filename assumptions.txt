Assumptions
1. Ace can only be high (14) and cannot be used as a low (1)
2. Royal flush against a royal flush has negligible probability, so we can assume there is no tie-breaker between the two (Tied game). This also means that mutual royal flush case will not be considered in this program
3. There can be no tied games in this program. (Tie-breaker functions will break the tie, except if two royal flushes are against each other)
